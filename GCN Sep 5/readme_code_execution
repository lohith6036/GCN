Currently we can run the code in 2 different ways
First 
python train.py  --dataset cora  
where cora is the name of the dataset
second
I have given the dataset name in the method. so we can call directly the py file
python train.py     /*   only the python file is enough as i cannot give input as a file in debugging mode*/
